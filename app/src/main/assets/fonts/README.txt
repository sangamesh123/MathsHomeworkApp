Place RobotoMono-Regular.ttf in this folder with the exact filename:

  app/src/main/assets/fonts/RobotoMono-Regular.ttf

It will be loaded at runtime by Tables and TableDisplayActivity. If the file is missing, the app falls back to the built-in monospace font.

Roboto Mono is available under the Apache License 2.0 from the official Google Fonts repository.
